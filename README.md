Welcome to supre-trend! This repository hosts a project focused on analyzing stock trends, particularly emphasizing the Supertrend indicator and the 52-week high and low points.

## Project Overview:

In this project, we delve into the dynamic world of stock market analysis, honing in on two significant aspects:

1. **Supertrend Touch of Stocks:**
   The Supertrend indicator is a powerful tool used by traders and investors to identify trends in stock prices. Our project explores the application of Supertrend in analyzing stock movements, aiming to uncover insightful patterns and signals.

2. **52-Week High and Low:**
   The 52-week high and low points of a stock represent its highest and lowest prices over the past year, respectively. Understanding these levels is crucial for assessing a stock's performance and potential future movements. Our project includes analysis and visualization of these pivotal points.

Happy analyzing and happy trading!
